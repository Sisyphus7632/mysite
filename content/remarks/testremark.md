If we're trying to pursue some kind of uniqueness, then almost by definition, we should not expect ourselves to be treated with complete justice by "the system"—whether that be other people's mental models, the education system, or society at large. After all, to be treated with perfect justice by a system implies that one is fully legible or predictable within its rules.

The above statement can be made somewhat quantifiable: a person's uniqueness might be measured by the extent to which they are misunderstood or misclassified by the system. However, it's important to remember that uniqueness does not necessarily imply greatness, intelligence, or value—it simply means being hard to classify.
