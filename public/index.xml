      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;rsquo;re trying to pursue some kind of uniqueness, then almost by definition, we should not expect ourselves to be treated with complete justice by &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo;—whether that be other people&amp;rsquo;s mental models, the education system, or society at large. After all, to be treated with perfect justice by a system implies that one is fully legible or predictable within its rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above statement can be made somewhat quantifiable: a person&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness might be measured by the extent to which they are misunderstood or misclassified by the system. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that uniqueness does not necessarily imply greatness, intelligence, or value—it simply means being hard to classify.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
